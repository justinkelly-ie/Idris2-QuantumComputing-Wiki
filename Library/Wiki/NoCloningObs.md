# Quantum No-Cloning Theorem Literate Specification

The No-Cloning Theorem states that an arbitrary unknown quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ cannot be duplicated.

In Idris 2 QTT, attempting to clone a linear Qubit (`1 _ : Qubit`) is rejected at compile-time by QTT linear consumption constraints!

### What We Learned from Implementation

1. **No-Cloning is a QTT Type Invariant**: Quantum state non-clonability does not require complex linear algebra proofs; it is enforced directly by Idris 2 QTT linear consumption (`1 _ : Qubit`).
2. **Compile-Time Rejection**: Attempting to duplicate a linear quantum token is caught by the compiler before execution.
